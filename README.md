This code functions by starting a timer when the quiz start button is pressed, then presenting the user with multiple-choice questions. The user answer is compared to an answer sheet, if it is correct the quiz will continue on to the next question and the user recieves 10 points. If the answer is incorrect they will remain on the current question and 10 seconds will be subtracted from the clock. When the timer reaches 0 or the user runs out of questions, they are prompted to save their score locally.
